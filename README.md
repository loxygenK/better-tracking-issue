# 🏁 `loxygenK/better-tracking-issue`

A GitHub Action to make issues in [task lists]() more visible.

### How it works

1. When the action is invoked, the action checks the diff of the issue body and see if there is
   a change in the task list.
2. If there is a change, the action modifies issue in the changed list.
